You have to create  Hotel class that represents hotel booking information, with fields for hotelId(int), hotelName(string), dateBooked(String), numOfRooms(int), wifi(string), and bill(double).

Implement two functions:

->findNumOfRoomsa //accept list of hotels and a string month

This function should take a array of hotels and a string representing a month (e.g., "may"). It should return the number of rooms booked in the hotel that was booked in the specified month.

->searchByWifi

This function should take a array of hotels and a string representing the wifi availability (either "yes" or "no"). It should return the hotel that has the second highest bill among those that have the specified wifi availability.
Example:
Given the following hotel data:


Test Case 1:
Input: findNumOfRooms(hotels, "may")
Output: 5

Test Case 2:
Input: searchByWifi(hotels, "yes")
Output: 103 (since Hotel Accord has the second highest bill)

Additional Test Cases:
Test Case 3:
Input: findNumOfRooms(hotels, "feb")
Output: 3
Test Case 4:

Input: findNumOfRooms(hotels, "jan")
Output: 10
Test Case 5:

Input: searchByWifi(hotels, "no")
Output: null (since no hotels have wifi as "no")
Test Case 6:

Input: searchByWifi(hotels, "yes")
Output: 103 (Hotel Accord still has the second highest bill)
Notes:
If no hotel is booked in the specified month, findNumOfRooms should return 0.
If there is no second-highest bill hotel in the list returned by searchByWifi, the function should return null.
