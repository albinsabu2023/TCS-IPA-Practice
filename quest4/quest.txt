create c class  Car having 

carId -int
brand -string
testConducted -int
testPassed -int
environment -String

create constructors gettes and setters for each of these private variables 

->
read the input in main method  using Scanner class (4 cars)

#create a static method findByPassedEnv that accept a list of cars and a string (environment) as input 
it should return an integer which is the number of test passes for the given input env that 
matches the array of cars objects . if no env matches it should print  "no matching env"


#create a static method findGrade that accept a list of cars and a string(brand)
it should return a string(grade) on the basis rating by following formula only if that matches the given brand 

rating =(testPassed *100) /testConducted
grade= "A1" if rating >80
grade= "B2"  if rating <80;


if no brand matches , print  "no matching brand"

output1 
---------
no matching envs
no matching brand

explanation there is no input matching Desert1 as environment 
also no matching environment called Mercedez1

ouput2 
--------

1900
B2

explanation 

1900 is the sum of testPassed by the car that having environment as desert (1500+400)
B2 =given brand -Mercedez  
    rating =(400*100)/1000
    rating =40 
    rating<80 therfore grade ="B2"
